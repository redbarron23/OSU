/*
 * 4. (4) Create a program that:
File must be called: structPointer.cpp
a. creates a struct variable,
b. creates a pointer to that struct variable,
c. and demonstrates that a struct pointer works similarly to a normal pointer.
Accessing its address is normal (cout << person_ptr; should yield its address if assigned),
but be aware that trying to print the dereferenced struct will likely not compile (cout << *person_ptr;
because we do not know how to insert (<<) a person struct into an output stream))...
d. Now try to access its members through the pointer... (you may find this arrow notation useful here: 
person_ptr->name).
(Note: the arrow dereferences the pointer similar to the * and accesses a member similar to the dot ( . ) 
when you have the direct object)
e. Now try to create an array of the struct (person friends[5];), fill in the variables, and access the member 
variable values.
