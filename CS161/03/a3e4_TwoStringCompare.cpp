/*
* (4 points) Write a piece of code using a loop that accepts two strings and returns whether they have the same contents with the use of a loop to check each character individually,
* (hint: you can compare individual characters with the <, ==, and > operators)

* Discussion idea: is there an easier way to check for equality of two strings? Why might I require you to “do
it the hard way”?
