/*
* (4 points) Find out how to use a simple random number:
* a. Visit http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/, my sample code directory, the tutorials I mention,
* and any searches you want (including the book if you can find something good in there :) ),
* b. Print some random numbers using a loop (say 10 of them),

* Discuss: Run the program a few times and see what happens, did you get the same numbers multiple times? What is happening here? Can we fix this?
