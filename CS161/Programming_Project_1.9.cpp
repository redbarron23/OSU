// Programming Project” 1.9
/*
 * 1. Complete Programming Project 1.9 from the textbook (Absolute C++ 5th edition, page 43), 
 *    The video game machines at your local arcade output coupons depending on how well you play the game. 
 *    You can redeem 10 coupons for a candy bar or 3 coupons for a gumball. 
 *    You prefer candy bars to gumballs. 
 *    Write a program that inputs the number of coupons you win 
 *    and outputs how many candy bars and gumballs you can get if you spend all of your coupons on candy bars first 
 *    and any remaining coupons on gumballs.
 *
 *    but with the following modifications:
 *    a. First write the program using division and remainder 
 *       (or some other straight forward mathematical  techniques)
 *
 *    b. Then write the program (in another file or a copy!) instead using a loop to remove coupons 
 *       for each each candy bar, a second loop for the gumballs, and also print how many remaining 
 *       coupons are left over (no loop needed for this third part if you do not want to),
 *       The video game machines at your local arcade output coupons depending on how well you play the
 *       game. You can redeem 10 coupons for a candy bar or 3 coupons for a gumball. You prefer candy
 *       bars to gumballs. Write a program that inputs the number of coupons you win and outputs how many candy bars and gumballs you can get if you spend all of your coupons on candy bars first and any remaining coupons on gumballs.”
 * (optional) For some extra practice with loops and output, consider printing a shape using letters for each candy bar, a different set of letter for a shape for each gumball, and a third shape for each of the left over coupons. Ask about this and look up ASCII art if you do not understand why this is a significant idea.
 *
 *  Before beginning any coding on a project, draw or write out approximately what the portion of the program will look like. Be sure that you show us that you understand the various aspects of the problem, the solution,
 *  and that you will be able to test your solution (think of your tests as you are designing and coding up your solution, this is called test driven development and it works wonders for writing complete programs).
