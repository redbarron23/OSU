3. (4) Programming Project 3.1 from Absolute C++ (p138 in the 5e book)
File must be called: mpg.cpp
“A liter is 0.264179 gallons. Write a program that will read in the number of liters of gasoline consumed by the user’s car and the number of miles traveled by the car and will then output the number of miles per gallon the car delivered. Your program should allow the user to repeat this calculation as often as the user wishes. Define a function to compute the number of miles per gallon. Your program should use a globally defined constant for the number of liters per gallon.”
Discussion idea: Why in the world would I ask you to do such a simple calculation in a function (hint: what might the general purpose of a function be)?
