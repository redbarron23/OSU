/*
1. (4) Write a simple function that accepts two strings and returns whether they have the same contents with the use of a loop to check each character individually.
File must be called: retFun.cpp
(hint: you can compare individual characters with the <, ==, and > operators)
(hint: reusing code you have written may be a good idea... are there any challenges or easy mistakes you could make in doing this?)
