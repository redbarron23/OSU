 *     Before beginning any coding on a project, draw or write out approximately what the portion of the program will look like. Be sure that you show us that you understand the various aspects of the problem, the solution,
 *     and that you will be able to test your solution (think of your tests as you are designing and coding up your solution, this is called test driven development and it works wonders for writing complete programs).
