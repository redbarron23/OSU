4. (3) Programming Project 13.1 from Absolute C++ (p607 in the 5e book),
File must be called: recFun.cpp
“Write a recursive function definition for a function that has one parameter n of typeintand that returns the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci numbers are F0 is 1, F1 is 1, F2 is 2, F3 is 3, F4 is 5, and in general
￼Fi+2 =Fi +Fi+1 fori=0,1,2,...”
Discuss: later elements rely on earlier elements, so how many elements do we need to have provided to start this recursive process?
