3. (3) Programming Project 4.17 from Absolute C++ (p183 in the 5e book),
File must be called: sortFun.cpp
“Write a function named sort that takes three integer parameters by reference. The function should rearrange the parameter values so that the first parameter gets set to the smallest value, the second parameter gets set to the second smallest value, and the third parameter gets set to the largest value. For example, given the variable assignmentsa = 30; b = 10; c = 20;then the function call sort(a,b,c)should result in a =10, b =20, and c =30. Note that the array construct covered in Chapter 5 will give you a way to solve this problem for an arbitrary number of items instead of only for three items”
