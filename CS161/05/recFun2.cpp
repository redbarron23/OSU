“Consider a frame of bowling pins, where each * represents a pin: *
** ***
**** *****
There are five rows and a total of fifteen pins. If we had only the top four rows, there would be a total of ten pins. If we had only the top three rows, there would be a total of six pins. If we had only the top two rows, there would be a total of      three pins. If we had only the top row, there would be a total of one pin.
Write a recursive function that takes as input the number of rows, n, and outputs the total number of pins that would exist in a pyramid with n rows. Your program should allow for values of n that are larger than 5.”
Discuss: There is a nice looking sigma-notation expression (a sum) that describes the total number of pins given n rows, can you find or create that expression?
