/*
 * Remember before you begin coding to draw or write out what this program will do. Also, remember to think of what tests you could use as you design and code up your solution.
 * (Note: you may be able to jump in and program a solution to this program with a bit of time, but you need to pay attention to how you decide what techniques you are using, why you are using them, and whether there are any other options available to you)
 * Discuss: what do your designs looked like, how did you go from design to program, what did you do to make sure your program was working correctly (consider letting someone else test your program to see if they can break it).

“Consider a frame of bowling pins, where each * represents a pin: *
There are five rows and a total of fifteen pins. If we had only the top four rows, there would be a total of ten pins. If we had only the top three rows, there would be a total of six pins. If we had only the top two rows, there would be a total of three pins. If we had only the top row, there would be a total of one pin.
Write a recursive function that takes as input the number of rows, n, and outputs the total number of pins that would exist in a pyramid with n rows. Your program should allow for values of n that are larger than 5.”
Discuss: There is a nice looking sigma-notation expression (a sum) that describes the total number of pins given n rows, can you find or create that expression?
