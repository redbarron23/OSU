/*
 *  Write a program that will allow two users to play tic-tac-toe.
 *  The program should ask for moves alternately from player X and player O.
 *  The program displays the game positions as follows:
 
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9
 
 * The players enter their moves by entering the position number they wish to mark.
 * After each move, the program displays the changed board. A sample board con- figuration is as follows:

    X X O
    4 5 6
    O 8 9
 
 * 4. (5) Programming Project 5.9 from Absolute C++ (p234 in the 5e book) specifically using a one-dimensional array,
 * (tic-tac-toe with one dimensional array... you might find it easier to do this with two dimensions first!)
 * File must be called: tictactoe.cpp
